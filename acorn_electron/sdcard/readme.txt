# Key Binds

Most non-shifted keys on the Electron have been mapped to the same non-shifted 
key on a regular keyboard, however, the shifted and ctrl states will be the
Electron symbol not the symbol shown on a regular keyboard.

For example, the "shift+8" on a normal keyboard output "*" whilst on the 
Electron you get a "(". The "*" symbol is actually on the "shift+:" key.

Exceptions to this are:

  - COPY key is bound to "["
  - : and * are moved to the equals key "="
