# Acorn Electron Core

This repository contains an Acorn Electon core for the FPGA Replay.

# Building

In order to build the core you'll need to copy the replay\_lib/
and lib/ directories from the [Replay Library SVN](http://svn.fpgaarcade.com/)
into the repo root, or (preferably) provide sym links to those
directories in your Replay library checkout.

Should any examples fail to build with the latest version of the
Replay Library please let me know. 

A series of blog posts covering this core are available on
[my website](https://www.mups.co.uk/post/2017/07/acorn-electron-fpga-project/)

More informtation about the FPGA Replay Board can be found on
the official [FPGA Replay website](http://www.fpgaarcade.com/).
