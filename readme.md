# About

Acorn Electon core for the [FPGA Replay](http://www.fpgaarcade.com/)

Please refer to [sdcard/readme.md](sdcard/readme.md) for usage/status information.

A series of blog posts covering this core are available on
[my website](https://www.mups.co.uk/post/2017/07/acorn-electron-fpga-project/)

# Building

Building requires a checkout of the [Replay Common](https://github.com/Takasa/replay_common)
repository.

The build scripts expect both this repository and the replay\_common repository 
to be cloned into the same parent directory.

# License

Most code is provided under the FPGA Arcade License. Some files include
a non-commericial clause.
